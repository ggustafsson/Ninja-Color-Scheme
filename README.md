Description
-----------
This color scheme is meant to be used with graphical Vim or under a 256 colors
terminal. Pretty much everything looks exactly the same under both.

Under 8 or 16 color terminals very few colors are changed from the default
color scheme but it's still an improvement and good if you want a consistent
look under all different environments.

Usage
-----
Download the **ninja.vim** file and put it in **~/.vim/colors/** and run
**:colorscheme ninja** within Vim (add line to **~/.vimrc** or **~/.gvimrc** if
you want the setting to stick).

Ninja works great with **Pathogen** so if you are already using it you then you
can put this whole Git repository under **~/.vim/bundle** for a hassle free
installation.

Extra
-----
The file **Extras/Terminal.png** contains a screenshot that can be used to
easily change the colors in Terminal.app using the color picker. I use the
"Pro" profile as a starting point and then i disable bold fonts, enable bright
colors for bold text and then i change the bright colors using the image.

Suggestions
-----------
If you think i should change something just email me at **gustafsson.g at
gmail.com** with specific highlight group(s) and color(s).  Preferably attach a
screenshot of the modification so i can easily see it.
