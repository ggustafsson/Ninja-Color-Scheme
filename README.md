Ninja Color Scheme
==================

Description
-----------
My *AWESOME* color scheme for Vim text editor. *1980s style ninja powah!*

The default colors are pretty good so i only changed the things that is not good enough for me. Kept it simple.


Installation
------------
Download the *ninja.vim* file and put it in *~/vim/colors* and run *:colorscheme ninja* within Vim (add line to *~/.vimrc*).


Suggestions
-----------
If you think i should change something just email me at *gustafsson.g at gmail.com* with specific highlight group(s) and color(s). Preferably attach a screenshot of the modification so i can easily see it.


**NOTE:** I've only tried this color scheme on the latest version of MacVim so if something looks odd email me or fix it yourself.
