Ninja Color Scheme
==================

Description
-----------
My *AWESOME* color scheme for Vim text editor. *1980s style ninja powah!*

The default colors are pretty good so i only changed the things that is not
good enough for me. Kept it pretty simple.


Installation
------------
Download the **ninja.vim** file and put it in **~/vim/colors** and run
**:colorscheme ninja** within Vim (add line to **~/.vimrc** or **~/.gvimrc**).


Suggestions
-----------
If you think i should change something just email me at
**gustafsson.g at gmail.com** with specific highlight group(s) and color(s).
Preferably attach a screenshot of the modification so i can easily see it.


Notes
-----
I've only tried this color scheme on the latest version of MacVim so if
something looks odd email me or fix it yourself.
