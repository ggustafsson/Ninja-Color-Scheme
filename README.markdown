Ninja Color Scheme
==================

Description
-----------
My simple but awesome color scheme for the Vim text editor. The default colors
are pretty good so i only changed the things that wasn't good enough.

Usage
-----
Download the **ninja.vim** file and put it in **~/.vim/colors/** and run
**:colorscheme ninja** within Vim (add line to **~/.vimrc** or **~/.gvimrc** if
you want the setting to stick).

Suggestions
-----------
If you think i should change something just email me at
**gustafsson.g at gmail.com** with specific highlight group(s) and color(s).
Preferably attach a screenshot of the modification so i can easily see it.
